        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am Henry Lin. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Operations and Decision Technologies at the Paul Merage School of Business, UC Irvine. I hold a M.S. in Interdisciplinary Statistics and Operations Research from UNC Chapel Hill and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from UCLA.</p>
        <p> My research focuses on analyzing new business models in e-commerce and retail operations using game theory and optimization models. My current research centers around livestream commerce and studies several aspects of this emerging trend in retail:
        <ol>
          <li>stakeholder interactions such as negotiation between influencers and brands,
          <li>pricing and revenue sharing,
          <li>consumer behavior and revenue impact,
          <li>social implications such as the application of livestream commerce in rural areas for poverty reduction purposes,
          <li>inventory management and environmental impact.
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p> Another application that I am working on is retail operations for food recovery such as pricing schemes of food waste supermarkets. I am also broadly interested in business model innovations for socially responsible operations. </p>
        <p> I am on the 2024-2025 job market. </p>
